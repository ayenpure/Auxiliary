What questions do we ask for quality?
- How close is the camera configuration to Cinema Configuration? (focuses do they pass close through the center?)
- Can we relate number of pixels diposited to the qulaity?
- Can we use all the images to infer the complete geometry of the object?
- How is the placement of cameras? (must not be concentrated)

Algorithm to determine the quality.
- The distance between the O and the focal point should be acceptable.
- Camera Placements must be distributed evenly over the sphere.
